<h1>Privacy Policy for Axiron Studios Applications</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile games and applications developed and published by Axiron Studios on Google Play. This includes, but is not limited to, the following titles:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Brave Chick</li>
    <li>Ultimate Goalkeeper</li>
    <li>City Match 3 Quest</li>
    <li>Real City Car Drift</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
<p>Axiron Studios does not collect, store, process, or share any personal or sensitive user data directly. Our applications do not request personal information such as name, email address, phone number, home address, or precise location.</p>
<p>Some technical information may be processed automatically through built in game engines or third party services in order to provide core functionality. This information is not collected or stored by Axiron Studios.</p>

<h2>Third Party Services</h2>
<p>Some applications may use third party services that require certain non personal data to function. These services include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Unity Engine</li>
    <li>Google AdMob</li>
</ul>

<p>These third party providers may collect non personal information such as device model, device identifiers, coarse usage data, app interactions, crash information, and advertising identifiers for analytics and advertising purposes. Axiron Studios does not have access to or store this data.</p>

<p>Privacy policies of the third party providers can be found at:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Technologies</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Google AdMob and User Consent (UMP)</h2>
<p>Certain Axiron Studios applications may display advertisements provided by Google AdMob. To comply with AdMob policies and regional privacy requirements, our applications use the Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request user consent before showing ads where required by law.</p>

<p>The consent system works as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On first launch, the app presents the official Google UMP consent form.</li>
    <li>Users may allow personalized ads, allow non personalized ads, or decline consent where permitted.</li>
    <li>If the user declines personalized ads, only non personalized ads will be shown.</li>
    <li>The consent form may reappear if Google requires an update to the consent choices.</li>
</ul>

<p>All consent related data is handled by Google and is not collected or stored by Axiron Studios.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Axiron Studios does not knowingly collect personal data from children. If any personal information is discovered to have been collected unintentionally, it will be deleted immediately.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to ensure safe operation of our applications. Since no personal data is collected or stored directly by Axiron Studios, no sensitive user information is kept on our servers.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Axiron Studios may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page.</p>
